Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! I have chosen to share some of my recent coursework. As a current student working towards my master's degree in Data Science from Bellevue University, I am working on several different types of projects. My projects range from writing code, to writing proposals, to creating visualizations. I also hold double bachelor's degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics.
