# About Me

An experience data analyst currently modeling drinking water systems as a Research Fellow at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I am currently looking for my next challenge. I have experience working in Python, R, and SQL. I have highlighted some of my coursework here in this portfolio, but feel free to reach out with any specific questions you may have. 

I have three years experience working as an environmental chemist primarily with GC/MS and internship experience as a water chemist. I would love to work on projects that combines my chemical background with my data science skills. Additional industries of interest include consumer insights and entertainment.
