# Understanding Academic Success Predicors Through Modeling

Everyone wants to be good at school, but some students just seem have an advantage over others. What do they have that other students don't? The aim of this project is to understand the predictors of a studentâ€™s academic success. The final model takes into consideration a student's parental status, study habits, and diet. 

## The Data

The data is provided by Kaggle, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption). The dataset takes into consideration a student's parents' education levels, parents' mariatal status, study time, the student's romantic situation, and the student's alcohol consumption. 

## Technologies

Completed in Python, the following packages are used
 - Pandas
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
 - SciPy
 - StatsModel
 - Seaborn
 
# Launch

All necessary code is included in the Jupyter notebook. The data file can be found in the data folder.
