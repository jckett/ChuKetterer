# Classifying Images and Comments Using Neural Networks

Humans are relatively good at understanding which texts are related to each other and which photos possess similar qualities. But how do computers figure it out? This project builds a Neural Network classification models to fit image and text data.  

## The Data

The data was directly provided, but can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/y6vujlwl).

## Technologies

Completed in Python, the following packages are used
 - json_lines
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
 - SKLearn
 - nltk.tokenize
 - Seaborn
 - Keras
 
# Launch

All necessary code is included in the Jupyter notebook. The data files can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/y6vujlwl).
