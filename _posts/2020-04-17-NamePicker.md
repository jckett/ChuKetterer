If you've ever been involved in a large group exchange, you know how challenging it can be to coordinate signing people up for different pairing services. And who wants to sign up for a random account on a random site? No one. Use [this website](https://jckett.github.io/NamePicker/) instead for hassle free assignments!


You can also go [here](https://github.com/jckett/NamePicker) for the code.
